<h2>Specifications:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use at your own risk: This tool makes changes to your text and may modify things you didn't intend to. Just
            be sure to proof your output. You may want to process as HTML first so you can test your preview.</li>
        <li>Pasting in HTML code is <b><i>very much at your own risk.</i></b> For example if the text of a link in your
            code contains a cition, you will end up with a link inside a link.</li>
        <li>This tool will only create valid links if it is given valid citations</li>
        <li>Chapter and sutta numbers should be separated by either a period or a semicolon. (e.g. SN 3.5, AN 6:2)</li>
        <li>Ranges are not possible to link.</li>
        <li>There is a slight variation between citations in the SN and AN for SuttaCentral.net and DhammaTalks.org
            (Ajahn Thanissaro). This tool assumes citations on SuttaCentral.net</li>
        <li>SN = Saṁyutta Nikāya; Snp = Sutta Nipāta</li>
        <li>The original text should not contain any linked citations or they will be double linked in the final output.
        </li>
        <li>The text that you enter is never sent across the internet. All processing is done in your browser.</li>
    </ul>
